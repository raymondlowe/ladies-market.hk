# Copilot Instructions 

## 0. Core Principles
Accuracy (verify, never assume) ‚Ä¢ Completeness (finish and log) ‚Ä¢ Reusability (store research) ‚Ä¢ Currency (always note current year: run `date`).

## 1. Quick Workflow
1. Read `.private/last-job.md` + CHANGELOG.md.
2. Open / create `.private/TODO.md`; add next actions; remove lines when done (do not just strike through). Make TODO.md items into your own checklist, including "future" or "planned" items, and report progress updates as you work through your checklist.
3. Research (Tavily, Keywordseverywhere, GA4/GSC). Reuse prior material in `.private/` before new searches.
4. Implement (template first ‚Üí content ‚Üí links ‚Üí verification).
5. Log outcome: update `last-job.md`, append CHANGELOG entry, archive prior `last-job.md` as `completed-job-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md`.

## 2. File & Naming
`research-topic-YYYYMMDD.md`, `completed-job-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md`. Reference issue numbers or dates in commits. Never delete raw research‚Äîappend.

## 3. Error / Block Logging
Log errors or blocked tasks to `.private/errors.md` with timestamp + cause + proposed next step.

## 4. Research Rules
‚Äì Use MCP servers for research when saved research documents in .private are inadaquate (Tavily, ga4-gsc-mcp, Keywordseverywhere).  
‚Äì On timeout: `sleep 30` then retry (max 3).  
‚Äì Store verbatim search/extract outputs under `.private/` with descriptive filenames.  
‚Äì Before adding a recommendation (place / dish / activity) confirm existence + specifics (name, address, hours, price) via Tavily Extract; save evidence.

## 5. Content Creation & Expansion
Stub page = <100 words of actual content (exclude template boilerplate). Create via `cp template.dwt new-page.html` immediately when a viable topic is identified; seed with verified basics. Expand pages <500 words (net content) after research; measure with `wc` minus template baseline. Always add at least one unique local nuance / tip supported by research or quotes from real user reviews.

## 6. Writing Style

Write in clear, engaging prose‚Äîfluid and factual, with quiet elegance. Think *A Year in Provence*, not a wiki. Favor full sentences over bullets; transform fragments into rich, explanatory paragraphs that reveal *why* something matters.  

**Example (bad ‚Üí good):**  
*Bad:* `<li><strong>Clay Pot Cooking</strong>: Traditional vessels that enhance flavor development</li>`  
*Good:* `<p>There‚Äôs a quiet magic in cooking with clay. In village kitchens across the region, meals begin in unglazed pots‚Äîporous, earthy, drawn from local soil. Heated slowly over low flames, they absorb and radiate warmth with a patience metal never learns, allowing spices to unfold gradually, liquids to simmer without scorching, and meats to soften into silk. The result isn‚Äôt just food; it‚Äôs memory made tangible. Tomatoes deepen into sunset hues, herbs release their soul, and grains swell with the rhythm of time. This is not rustic compromise‚Äîit‚Äôs intention. For generations, these pots have held more than stew; they‚Äôve carried the taste of place, of season, of care. To eat from one is to taste continuity, a cuisine shaped not by speed, but by silence and heat.</p>`  

Keep paragraphs under ~250 words. Use subtle breaks‚Äîtips, quotes, or light design (borders, soft color, emoji like üçã or ü™ë)‚Äîto guide the reader, not decorate. Avoid filler, hype, and keyword stuffing.  

Tone: warm, authoritative, helpful‚Äîlike a trusted local sharing insights. Neutral-positive, never salesy. Write *with* the reader, not at them.

## 7. Localization
English base; include local terms (e.g. MTR, RER, S‚ÄëBahn) and optionally native script in parentheses. Use correct local currency symbol (HK$, ‚Ç¨, ¬£, US$ if non‚Äëlocal source ambiguity). Provide simple pronunciation when helpful.

## 8. Linking Policy
External: each real-world entity gets one authoritative link; verify with Tavily Extract; broken ‚Üí replace or remove. All external anchors: `target="_blank"`. If no official site, use reputable review / reference (Tripadvisor, Wikipedia, govt authority). Internal: ensure every new or expanded page is discoverable (contextual links + footer or nav if high value). Add 1‚Äì2 relevant internal links from the new page outward and from existing pages inward where logical.

## 9. Templates & HTML Hygiene
Edit inside editableRegion only. For structural changes edit the `.dwt`; replicate if needed. Use scripts (`sed`, `awk`) for bulk repetitive edits. Always close tags, especially `<script>`. Every `<img>` has concise descriptive `alt`. Maintain logical heading order. Remove dead comments / duplicate includes.

## 10. SEO & Keywords
Primary intent phrase appears once in natural H1. Use Keywordseverywhere (volume, CPC) + PASF for related expansions. Meta description: 140‚Äì155 chars, benefit-driven, no stuffing. Add unique insight rather than padding.

## 11. Performance & Monetization
Use ga4-gsc-mcp to spot: high impressions + low CTR/rank, high CPC terms lacking depth, pages just off page 1. Focus expansion there. Only AutoAds (no manual AdSense units). Do not degrade readability to force density around ads.

## 12. Research Expansion Heuristic
Found one beach? Look for 2‚Äì3 more notable ones. One local dish? Add other signature dishes. One fee? Gather comparable fees (hours / pricing tiers). Always cite sources in saved research files.

## 13. YouTube / First-Hand Signals
Check `.private/` for existing transcripts. If absent, use Tavily to locate relevant videos; extract transcript; save. Distill actionable visitor tips (best time, crowd patterns, hidden photo spot) and integrate succinctly. Try also tavily search for video transcripts.

## 14. Git & Issues
Every change ties to an issue (`#123`). Branch names: `content/<slug>` or `feature/<topic>`. Cohesive commits (e.g. "add external links", "expand history section"). No force push. No secrets / large binaries (>5MB). Reference issue in commit message.

## 15. Logging & Completion
When a job ends: archive old `last-job.md`, write new one (summary, what changed, next 3 priorities). Update CHANGELOG with concise bullet referencing issue.

## 16. Definition of Done (Page)
Structure logical; H1 unique. Paragraphs sized reasonably. Everything in checklist has been done. Everything in TODO.md that doesn't require user input is done. Required internal + external verified links present. Alt text complete. At least one differentiated local context element. No unverified claims. Template integrity preserved. Commit references issue and logs added.

## 17. Anti‚ÄëPatterns (Reject)
Filler expansions; repetitive keyword stuffing; artificial micro-headings; orphan pages with no inbound links; generic travel boilerplate; adding layout rewrites without a specific monetization task; excessive callouts (no more than one ever 4 full paragraphs).

## 18. Quick Edit Test
Keep only sentences adding who / what / why / when / how or unique context. Remove repetition, vague hype, or unverifiable speculation.

## 19. MCP Server Summary
Tavily Search/Extract ‚Üí verify facts & links.  
Keywordseverywhere ‚Üí primary + related queries (volume/CPC).  
ga4-gsc-mcp ‚Üí performance triage & opportunity targeting.


## 21. Example Issue Titles
‚Äì Expand <page> to exceed 500 words with verified specifics (#123).  
‚Äì Add authoritative outbound links & fix broken anchors (#124).  
‚Äì Remove manual AdSense units; enforce AutoAds only (#125).  
‚Äì Cross-link new attraction pages in navigation (#126).  
‚Äì Fix 404s from case-mismatched filenames (#127).

## 22. Example Bullet ‚Üí Paragraph Conversion (Another Sample)
Bad: `<li><strong>Beauty Services:</strong> Professional makeup application...</li>`  
Good: `<p><strong>Beauty Services</strong>: Skilled artists tailor makeup and skincare advice to visitor needs‚Äîday touring, evening dining, or photos‚Äîadding practical routines and locally relevant product guidance. Only when you have experienced the skilled hands of someone who has worked with diverse skin tones and types can you truly appreciate the artistry involved. Don't miss the chance to indulge in a transformative beauty experience.</p>`

## 23. Currency & Date Awareness
Confirm year-sensitive facts (events, seasonal closures) against current year (run `date`) and adjust wording (e.g. "In 2025 the..." if time-bounded).

## 24. Ads & Monetization Guardrail
Never insert individual AdSense units. If found, remove and document in CHANGELOG + issue.

## 25. Minimal Commit Message Format
`<scope>: <action> (#issue) ‚Äî <short outcome>`  
Example: `content: expand night-market guide (#342) ‚Äî +750w, links verified`.

## 26. Be thorougher, use checklists.
- Make your own internal check list of tasks to do, such as pages to process, and make sure you complete them.
